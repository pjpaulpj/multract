After you have downloaded the multract ado and stored it on your personal do file folder you can test out the command in Stata.

You may use the data within this folder to help test out multract. The "real data" comes from data from a field experiment in India collected using Survey CTO. The "fake data" was created to help debug the program.

Using the real data, you might try the following syntax:
multract if b2_9_what_buy!="", p(" ") varlab drop other(-98) na(-99)

Using the fake data you might try the following syntax:
multract if name=="qayam", p(" " / - ?) varlab gen(Q) other(-98) na(-99) miss(-333) na(-555)
